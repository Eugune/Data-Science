    "\n",
    "There are several main adjustments you may try.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please pay attention to the time it takes for each epoch to conclude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the code from the lecture as the basis, fiddle with the hyperparameters of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The *width* (the hidden layer size) of the algorithm. Try a hidden layer size of 200. How does the validation accuracy of the model change? What about the time it took the algorithm to train? Can you find a hidden layer size that does better?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Find the variable: \"hidden_layer_size\" and change it to 200.\n",
    "    The validation accuracy is significantly higher (as the algorithm with 50 hidden units was too simple of a model).\n",
    "    Naturally, it takes the algorithm much longer to train (unless early stopping is triggered too soon).\n",
    "    A hidden layer size of 500 (and not only) works even better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The *depth* of the algorithm. Add another hidden layer to the algorithm. This is an extremely important exercise! How does the validation accuracy change? What about the time it took the algorithm to train? Hint: Be careful with the shapes of the weights and the biases.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Adding another hidden layer to the algorithm is done in the same way as in the lecture.\n",
    "    We simply add a new line in Sequential:\n",
    "    tf.keras.layers.Dense(hidden_layer_size, activation='relu')\n",
    "    We can see that the accuracy of the model does not necessarily improve. This is an important lesson for us. Fiddling with a single hyperparameter may not be enough. Sometimes, a deeper net needs to also be wider in order to have higher accuracy. Maybe you need more epochs?\n",
    "    **ADDITIONAL TASK: Try this new model, but with a wider one (200-500 hidden units). Basically, combine this and the previous exercises**\n",
    "    In any case, it takes longer for the algorithm to train.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The *width and depth* of the algorithm. Add as many additional layers as you need to reach 5 hidden layers. Moreover, adjust the width of the algorithm as you find suitable. How does the validation accuracy change? What about the time it took the algorithm to train?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fiddle with the activation functions. Try applying sigmoid transformation to both layers. The sigmoid activation is given by the string 'sigmoid'.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Fiddle with the activation functions. Try applying a ReLu to the first hidden layer and tanh to the second one. The tanh activation is given by the string 'tanh'.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Adjust the batch size. Try a batch size of 10000. How does the required time change? What about the accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Adjust the batch size. Try a batch size of 1. That's the SGD. How do the time and accuracy change? Is the result coherent with the theory?\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Adjust the learning rate. Try a value of 0.0001. Does it make a difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Adjust the learning rate. Try a value of 0.02. Does it make a difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Combine all the methods above and try to reach a validation accuracy of 98.5+ percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!"

    "We'll apply all the knowledge from the lectures in this section to write a deep neural network. The problem we've chosen is referred to as the \"Hello World\" of deep learning because for most students it is the first deep learning algorithm they see.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is called MNIST and refers to handwritten digit recognition. You can find more about it on Yann LeCun's website (Director of AI Research, Facebook). He is one of the pioneers of what we've been talking about and of more complex approaches that are widely used today, such as covolutional neural networks (CNNs). \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provides 70,000 images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (1 digit per image). \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to write an algorithm that detects which digit is written. Since there are only 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), this is a classification problem with 10 classes. \n",
